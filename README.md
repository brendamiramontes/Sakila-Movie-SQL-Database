# Sakila Movie SQL Database Project 

Welcome to my Sakila Movie SQL Database Project  repository! This repository contains SQL queries and related files to showcase my skills in database management, data analysis, and visualization using this PostgreSQL [Sample Database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/).

## Contents

1. [Presentation: SQL Questions and Answers](./sql-project-miramontesb-PPT.pdf)
   - This PowerPoint presentation contains a series of SQL questions along with their answers. Each question challenges different aspects of database querying and manipulation.

3. [SQL Queries](./sql-queries.txt)
   - This file contains a collection of SQL queries used to generate the data for the presentation and data visualization. The queries demonstrate various SQL functionalities, including data retrieval, aggregation, subqueries, joining, CTE, and window functions.

## Usage

- **Presentation**: Open the PowerPoint pdf presentation to view SQL questions and their corresponding answers. Use this resource to assess my knowledge and problem-solving skills in SQL. The data visualization charts to understand how SQL queries can be used to derive meaningful insights from data. The visualization highlights key metrics and trends.
  
- **SQL Queries**: Explore the SQL queries file to see the code behind the presentation and data visualization. Feel free to review, modify, or run the queries to analyze the data further.
